# Creating your first matrix in R

# there are multiple ways of doing it.

#lets see one by one

# 1. matrix() function

#lets create a data first.

myData <- 1:20
myData


myFirstMatrix <- matrix(myData, 4,5) #4 is number of rows and 5 is number of columns in a matrix

myFirstMatrix


# lets create the same matrix in a different manner

myFirstMatrix <- matrix(myData, 4,5, byrow = TRUE)


#2. rbind() function

data1 <- c("Welcome","To", "www.codeinfo.net")
data2 <- c("Have a", "Great", "Day!!")
data3 <- c(1,10, 20)


rbindMatrix <- rbind(data1, data2, data3)

rbindMatrix


#3. cbind() function

c1 <- 1:10
c2 <- 11:20

cbindMatrix <- cbind(c1,c2)
cbindMatrix
